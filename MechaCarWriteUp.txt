AutosRUs MechaCar Analysis

Section 1  MechaCar mpg Analysis

    In this section, our goal is to predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

    we have mpg as dependent variable and vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, groud clearance and AWD
    as our potential independent variables.

    We used cor() function to quantify the strength of the correlation between variables. Correlation matrix is included.

    Based on our understanding of automobile and correlation matrix, We picked vehicle_length, vehicle_weight,
    ground_clearance and AWD as independent variables for our multiple linear regression model.

    The multiple linear regression model results show that:
    1. The Intercept provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
       It is -9.728e+01 and significant at 0.001 level.

    2. The slop of of the linear model is not zero.
       The coefficient of vehicle_length is 6.0811 and is significant at 0.001 level.
       The coefficient of vehicle_weight is 1.169e-03 and is significant at 0.1 level.
       The coefficient of ground_clearance is 3.419 and is significant at 0.001 level.
       
    3. R-squared value is 0.708. This linear model can predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes at 70.8% acurracy.

Section 2  Suspension Coil Analysis

        One Sample Chi-Square test on variance

        data:  Suspension_Coil$PSI
        X-squared = 92.817, df = 149, p-value = 8.951e-05
        alternative hypothesis: true variance is less than 100
        95 percent confidence interval:
        0.00000 76.21287
        sample estimates:
        variance of x 
            62.29356 
 
        We conducted a one sample variance test with null hypothesis: true variance is greater than 100.
        p-value is 8.951e-05. We reject null hypothesis.
        The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils
        must not exceed 100 pounds per inch.

    2. The suspension coil’s pound-per-inch results are statistically different from the mean population results of
       1,500 pounds per inch because p-value < 2.2e-16, we reject the null hypothesis: sample mean = 1,500.

Section 3  Future Study

    Our current study is on the data of AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar. Since competitors' products can dramatically
    affact AutosRUs’ sales, We need consider the performance of the MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market. 
    
    For this purpose, we need compare some traditional car characteristics that buyer care about, like price, fuel efficiency, color options,
    car size and service. Other than these, since technology has become the deciding factor for car buyers selecting a vehicle,
    we also need consider safety features like automatic emergency braking, Forward collision warning, blind spot alert and rear cross traffic warning. 
    Some desired technologies of all are convenience and entertainment features like in-car Wi-Fi and voice commands. 

    To compare MechaCar with other comparable vehicles on the market, we need collect other manufacturers' data. 
    We need their price and promotions, mpg, car size. These are countinious numerical variables.
    We also need their color and service options, safety features options and other convenience and entertainment features options. 
    These are categorical variables.

    To quantify the differnces between MechaCar and other comparable cars, we can conduct two sample t-test for the mean of those numerical variables.
    We can conduct Chi-Square test for those categorical variables.
